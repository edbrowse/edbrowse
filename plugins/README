Chrome, or any other commercial browser, comes equipped with plugins.
You don't have to go fishing around for them, then paste them into your
config file. The music plays, the pdf file renders, etc.
Edbrowse will never be that streamlined, but this is an attempt to get closer.

This directory contains plugins for common tasks.
In some cases there are different plugins for the same task, using different
players, because we all have our personal preferences.
If you want a different player, you will need to customize the file
or write your own.

Sometimes the suffix is nothing more than a key to the plugin database.
Suppose a plugin descriptor says:
	suffix = snork
snork is not a standard file extension.
You won't see this-and-that.snork in the wild.
However, you can type b.snork, or pb.snork, or g.snork in directory mode,
to invoke the snork plugin on the file.
We will use this trick from time to time.

All files in this directory are text files.
I don't want characters to have meaning when a file is rendered,
and I don't want to escape certain characters with backslash.
The plugin is the plugin; just copy it into, or reference it from,
your .ebrc file.
The supporting shell script is the shell script; just install it into your bin.

You can disable plugins with the pg- command.
Plugins don't run until you enable them again.
You can disable plugins on a one-time basis with the g- command.
