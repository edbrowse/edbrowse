# Music and podcasts are typically contained in mp3 files.
# mpg123 is specifically designed to play mp3 files, although there are other players.
# Here is the plugin for mp3, using mpg123.

plugin {
type = audio/mp3
desc = audio file in mp3 format
suffix = mp3
content = audio/mpeg
program = mpg123 -q -C %i
}

# When edbrowse encounters a url that ends in .mp3,
# or has an http content type of audio/mpeg,
# it plays the audio passage, just like any other browser.
# Similarly, g in directory mode will play the audio if it is an mp3 file.
# The -C option provides keyboard control.
# Use space to stop and start the music, 1 through 0 to move around in the file,
# comma to back up, period to move forward, and so on.

# The author of mpg123 was kind enough to add a feature for me,
# wherein the music pauses when mpg123 receives signal 10 from another process.
# With this in mind,
# establish the following hot keys through your adapter
# or using a daemon like esekeyd:

# sysrq|amixer -q set Master 3%-
# scroll|amixer -q set Master 3%+
# pause|killall -s10 mpg123

# I can be in any console, in any application, and adjust the volume of my music,
# or pause it altogether if I have to concentrate on my work or answer the phone,
# using the three keys at the upper right.
# This replicates the layout of the Mac.
# You might prefer another player, like mpv,
# but it cannot pause and restart from another console via signal 10.
# There is more information on hot keys in the sister project acsint,
# in doc/music_speech.txt.

# That said, there are times when mpv is preferred.
# Say you are listening to a podcast, and let's be honest,
# some of those podcasts are pretty slow.
# mpv uses brackets to change speed, without changing pitch.
# The technology is impressive!
# Here is the same descriptor using mpv.

# plugin {
# type = audio/mp3
# desc = audio file in mp3 format
# suffix = mp3
# content = audio/mpeg
# program = mpv %i
# }

# If you want mpv to emulate mpg123 at the keyboard, then do the following.
# Create the directory $HOME/.config/mpv
# Within that directory, create mpv.conf, containing:

# no-video
# really-quiet

# Create input.conf, containing:

# 1 seek 0 absolute-percent
# 2 seek 10 absolute-percent
# 3 seek 20 absolute-percent
# 4 seek 30 absolute-percent
# 5 seek 40 absolute-percent
# 6 seek 50 absolute-percent
# 7 seek 60 absolute-percent
# 8 seek 70 absolute-percent
# 9 seek 80 absolute-percent
# 0 seek 90 absolute-percent
# , seek -0.5 relative
# . seek +0.5 relative
# ; seek -2.0 relative
# : seek +2.0 relative
# b seek 0 absolute-percent
# d playlist-prev
# f playlist-next

# This is a faithful simulation,
# thus you can press the same keys, whether you are running mpg123 or mpv.

# Now suppose I want the best of both worlds.
# I want mpg123 to play mp3 files by default,
# but if I am listening to a podcast, I want to call upon mpv,
# with just a couple more keystrokes, so I can speed it up with the brackets.
# The virtual suffix mpv makes it easy to do.
# None of the files end in mpv, but you can pretend like they do.
# Install the following plugins, then type g for an mp3 song,
# and g.mpv for an mp3 podcast.

# plugin {
# type = audio/mp3
# desc = music in mp3 format
# suffix = mp3
# content = audio/mpeg
# program = mpg123 -q -C %i
# }

# plugin {
# type = audio/mp3
# desc = spoken word in mp3 format
# suffix = mpv
# program = mpv %i
# }

# Sound snippets are typically in wav files.
# This is a much simpler encoding.
# Here is a plugin for wav files and other files compatible with sox.

plugin {
type = audio/basic
desc = audio file in a wave format
suffix = wav,voc,au
content = audio/x-wav
program = play -q %i
}

# mpv plays video files in various formats.
# There may be pictures on the screen, I don't really know, but it plays the audio.

plugin {
type = video/mp4
desc = video file in mp4 format
suffix = mp4,m4a,webm
content = video/mpeg
program = mpv %i
}
