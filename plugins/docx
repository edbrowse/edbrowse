Going back to the 90's, Microsoft developed a format for its documents
under MS-Word. Nix developed a program to make these documents readable.
The same program handles rich text.

plugin {
type = Word doc
desc = Microsoft Word document, not docx
suffix = doc
content = application/msword
down_url
program = catdoc %i
outtype = T
}

plugin {
type = rtf
desc = rich text file
suffix = rtf
content = application/rtf
down_url
program = catdoc %i
outtype = T
}

Microsoft then upgraded the format, and created a new file extention, docx.

plugin {
type = docx
desc = microsoft docx
suffix = docx
content = application/docx
down_url
program = docx2txt %i
outtype = T
}

Portable document format (pdf) has become the gold standard.
Linux has programs to turn pdf into html or text.
html preserves hyperlinks and other formatting directives.
However, some documents are more readable when turned into text.
Once again I want the best of both worlds.
The default is text, but the virtual suffix pdfh turns pdf into html.

plugin {
type = pdf
desc = pdf file
suffix = pdf
content = application/pdf
down_url
program = pdftotext -q %i -
outtype = t
}

plugin {
type = pdf
desc = pdf file
suffix = pdfh
program = pdftohtml -i -q -stdout -noframes %i
outtype = h
}

plugin {
type = pdf
desc = pdf file with password
suffix = pdfp
program = pdftotext -q -opw %p %i -
outtype = t
}

Some pdf files, far too many, are simply a pdf wrapper around an image.
This happens if you scan a document with your phone, then turn it into pdf.
In that event, pdf to text produces an empty buffer, and pdf to html
produces one or more blank pages separated by <hr> lines.
The document is unreadable to us, and we have to leave it at that.
