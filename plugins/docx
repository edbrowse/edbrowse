Going back to the 90's, Microsoft developed a format for its documents
under MS-Word. Nix developed a program to make these documents readable.
The same program handles rich text.

plugin {
type = Word doc
desc = Microsoft Word document, not docx
suffix = doc
content = application/msword
down_url
program = catdoc %i
outtype = T
}

plugin {
type = rtf
desc = rich text file
suffix = rtf
content = application/rtf
down_url
program = catdoc %i
outtype = T
}

Microsoft then upgraded the format, and created a new file extention, docx.

plugin {
type = docx
desc = microsoft docx
suffix = docx
content = application/docx
down_url
program = docx2txt %i
outtype = T
}
