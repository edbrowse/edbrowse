It is possible to access and traverse the files inside a zip archive
as though it were a mounted file system.
If you are editing a directory, and MyOldWork.zip is one of the files,
type g, and you will see a page that says Zip Archive at the top,
with links to the files and directories at the top of the zip archive.
From there you can descend into subdirectories, or extract files.
Edbrowse never pulls the entire archive into a buffer, so the archive can be huge.

The system relies on a made-up protocol zipxd://
You will never find this protocol in the wild.
It is prepended to zip files and directories,
then used to trigger plugins which descend further into the zip archive.
A similar system could be set up for gzip, bzip2, tar, cpio, etc.

There are three plugins and a supporting bash script.
Below are the plugins, followed by the script, which should be placed in your bin.
The third plugin uses outtype = g, which is rare.
A rendering program usually generates text or html, but in this case,
the file could be anything. We don't know in advance what it is,
so use g for generic.
The script assumes none of the pathnames in the zip archive
contain the " or ; characters.
That isn't a good situation; we should fix this some day.

plugin {
type = zip
desc = zip archive
suffix = zip
program = ebunzip %i
from_file
outtype = H
}

plugin {
type = zip
desc = zip show directory
protocol = zipxd
program = ebunzip %i
outtype = H
}

plugin {
type = zip
desc = zip extract file
protocol = zipx
program = ebunzip %i
outtype = G
}

And now for the bash script that performs the magic.

#!/bin/bash
if [ $# != 1 ] ; then
echo "usage ebunzip zipfile[path]"
exit 1;
fi
#  gather the zip file and path
zf="$1"
path=""
if [[ "$zf" =~ @:@ ]] ; then
path=${zf/*@:@/}
zf=${zf/@:@*/}
#  check here for file extract
if [[ "$zf" =~ zipx: ]] ; then
zf=${zf/zipx:??/}
unzip -p "$zf" "$path"
exit 0
fi
zf=${zf/zipxd:??/}
fi
# we're generating html, whence we can make links that edbrowse understands
echo "<body>Zip Archive"
if [ -z "$path" ] ; then
#  this is the root directory
unzip -t "$zf" |
sort |
sed -e '/testing:/!d' -e 's/^.*testing: *//' -e 's/  *OK$//' \
-e '/\/./d' \
-e "s;.*;://$zf@:@&\">&</a>;" \
-e '/\/">/s/^/d/' \
-e 's;^;<br><a href="zipx;'
else
unzip -t "$zf" |
sort |
sed -e '/testing:/!d' -e 's/^.*testing: *//' -e 's/  *OK$//' \
-e "s;^$path;@:@&;" \
-e '/^@:@/!d' -e 's/^@:@//' \
-e "s;^$path;;" \
-e '/^$/d' \
-e '/\/./d' \
-e "s;.*;://$zf@:@$path&\">&</a>;" \
-e '/\/">/s/^/d/' \
-e 's;^;<br><a href="zipx;'
fi
echo "</body>"
